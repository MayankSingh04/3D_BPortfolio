# 🌐 3D Awwwards-Level Developer Portfolio

### Built with React, GSAP, Three.js, TailwindCSS

This is my **fully animated, interactive, 3D developer portfolio** built to leave a strong impression on recruiters, clients, and hiring managers. It’s not just a portfolio—it's a web experience with high-performance code, smooth scroll-based animations, and 3D visuals inspired by modern web design standards.

> ⚡ Inspired by top-tier Awwwards websites and developed using React (Vite), TailwindCSS, GSAP, React Three Fiber, and Drei.
